CHAPTER I

The one opened the door with a latch-key and went in, followed by a young
fellow who awkwardly removed his cap. He wore rough clothes that smacked
of the sea, and he was manifestly out of place in the spacious hall in which
he found himself. He did not know what to do with his cap, and was stuffing
it into his coat pocket when the other took it from him. The act was done
quietly and naturally, and the awkward young fellow appreciated it.
"He understands," was his thought. "He’ll see me through all right."
He walked at the other’s heels with a swing to his shoulders, and his legs
spread unwittingly, as if the level floors were tilting up and sinking down
to the heave and lunge of the sea. The wide rooms seemed too narrow for
his rolling gait, and to himself he was in terror lest his broad shoulders
should collide with the doorways or sweep the bric-a-brac from the low mantel.
He recoiled from side to side between the various objects and multiplied the
hazards that in reality lodged only in his mind. Between a grand piano and a
centre-table piled high with books was space for a half a dozen to walk abreast,
yet he essayed it with trepidation.
